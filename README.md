# Seo Optimization Horiseon

## Description

The code for the Horsiseon webpage was working very well at first glance, however upon inspection I noticed that the code had repeated html semantic elements. I managed to change all the <div> elements with the appropiate semantic elements, in order for future coders to be able to distinguish the different parts of the webpage. Also not all of the links within the webpage were working effectively. I managed to find the problem which was one of the code links was just missing the <id> element. As well as added alt to all the images. Finally, the stlye.css had the same issue of having repeated code. I was capable of considlating most, however I did have trouble with a few due to not changing a class from one of my semantic elements. 

## Usage of Image
 
The link provided makes it easier to access the image of the website, however if you would like to see it through the VS code click on assets then on images and look for screenshot.horiseon.png.
